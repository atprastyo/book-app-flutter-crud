# book_crud

A basic CRUD Flutter project.

<i> In this project we will use trending local storage packages we will determine how long it takes each option below to perform the operations, so we can have a clear understanding of which is the best choice for us. 
The project is implementing  a clean architecture & bloc for state management so that it’s easy to understand and easy to change as the project grows in the future and implement new technologies or packages.
